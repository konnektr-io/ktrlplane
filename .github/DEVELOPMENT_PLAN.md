## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Key Insight: db-query-operator Simplification

We use the [db-query-operator](https://github.com/konnektr-io/db-query-operator) for deployment management. This dramatically simplifies our approach:

1. **Store user settings** in the existing `settings_json` column
2. **db-query-operator** queries our database and deploys resources
3. **No complex infrastructure management** needed in KtrlPlane
4. **Focus on UI and user experience**

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go 1.24+ with Gin framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ with GORM
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + shadcn/ui + Zustand
- **Authentication**: Auth0
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes with db-query-operator
