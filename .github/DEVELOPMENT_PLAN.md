## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Key Insight: db-query-operator Simplification

We use the [db-query-operator](https://github.com/konnektr-io/db-query-operator) for deployment management. This dramatically simplifies our approach:

1. **Store user settings** in the existing `settings_json` column
2. **db-query-operator** queries our database and deploys resources
3. **No complex infrastructure management** needed in KtrlPlane
4. **Focus on UI and user experience**

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go 1.24+ with Gin framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ with GORM
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + shadcn/ui + Zustand
- **Authentication**: Auth0
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes with db-query-operator

## üî• Logging & Metrics Backend (Loki/Mimir Proxy)

### Overview
KtrlPlane will provide secure, multi-tenant proxy endpoints for logs and metrics, integrating with Loki (logs) and Mimir (metrics) backends. All requests are authenticated, authorized, and scoped to the correct tenant using X-Scope-OrgID headers.

### Endpoints
- **Logs:** `GET /api/v1/resources/{resourceId}/logs?query={logQL}&start={ts}&end={ts}&limit=1000`
- **Metrics:** `GET /api/v1/resources/{resourceId}/metrics/query_range?query={promQL}&start={ts}&end={ts}&step=15s`

### Architecture
1. **Authentication:** All endpoints require Auth0 JWT (existing middleware).
2. **Authorization:** Use `PermissionService.CanUserAccessResource(userID, resourceID)` to enforce RBAC for each request.
3. **Tenant Scoping:** Use `ResourceService.GetResourceTenantID(resourceID)` to fetch the tenant ID and inject `X-Scope-OrgID` header for Loki/Mimir multi-tenancy.
4. **Query Rewriting:**
  - For logs: Rewrite LogQL query to inject resource-specific label filter (e.g., `pod_selector_label`).
  - For metrics: Optionally rewrite PromQL query for resource scoping.
5. **Reverse Proxy:** Use Go's `httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy` to forward requests to Loki/Mimir, with custom Director for header injection and query rewriting.
6. **Error Handling:**
  - 403/404 for denied or not found (do not leak resource existence)
  - 500 for internal errors
7. **Security:** Never forward requests without RBAC check and tenant header. Log denied/failed attempts for audit.
8. **Testability:** All proxy logic is dependency-injected for easy mocking in tests.

### Implementation Notes
- Proxy logic will be in `internal/api/proxy.go`.
- Endpoints will be added to `internal/api/routes.go`.
- All code follows clean architecture and security best practices.

## üîÑ Continuous Improvements

  - Resource creation page should auto-select last active project (from localStorage/Zustand)
  - If no project is found, prompt user to select or create a project
  - Add project selection dropdown to resource creation page, defaulting to last active project, but allowing user to choose another
  - If user changes project, update resource creation flow accordingly
  - Ensure flow works for users with multiple projects, no projects, or when coming from direct link

**Edge Cases:**
  - If user is not authenticated, redirect to login
  - If user has no projects, prompt to create one before proceeding
  - If user has multiple projects, allow selection via dropdown

**User Experience:**
  - Seamless flow: homepage ‚Üí login (if needed) ‚Üí resource creation page (with project selection) ‚Üí resource configuration


- [ ] Update progress on current phase tasks
- [ ] Review and adjust priorities based on user feedback
- [ ] Update architectural decisions and learnings
- [ ] Plan next week's objectives

### Monthly Planning

- [ ] Review phase completion and timeline
- [ ] Adjust roadmap based on business priorities
- [ ] Update resource allocation and dependencies
