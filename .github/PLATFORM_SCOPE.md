# Konnektr Platform - Application Scope & Boundaries

## üéØ Overview

This document defines the scope, responsibilities, and boundaries for each application within the Konnektr Platform to prevent overlapping functionality, reduce development friction, and ensure all components integrate into a cohesive, scalable, and maintainable system.

## üèóÔ∏è Platform Architecture

### Control Plane vs Data Plane

The Konnektr Platform is divided into two distinct logical planes:

**Control Plane (KtrlPlane, DB Query Operator)**

- Manages lifecycle of all resources, users, organizations, billing, and access control
- Central administrative backbone of the entire platform
- Provides centralized authentication and authorization

**Data Plane (Products: Graph, Flow, Assembler, Compass)**

- User-facing products for building and running digital twin solutions
- Tenants of the Control Plane
- Focus on domain-specific functionality

## üìã Guiding Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns

Each application has a single primary responsibility and excels at that function.

### 2. Decoupled Architecture

- No direct knowledge of other applications' internal logic or databases
- All interactions through well-defined, versioned REST/gRPC APIs
- Asynchronous communication via message bus (Dapr)

### 3. Declarative Operations

- Data Plane applications make declarative requests to KtrlPlane API
- KtrlPlane and DB Query Operator reconcile desired vs actual state
- No direct infrastructure management by product applications

### 4. Centralized Identity & Access Management

- All authentication/authorization managed by KtrlPlane
- Other applications are clients of KtrlPlane's IAM service
- No separate user tables in product databases

### 5. Consistent User Experience

- All applications use shared Konnektr Design System (shadcn/vite)
- Seamless experience across the platform

## üè¢ Application Scopes

### KtrlPlane (Control Plane) - **THIS APPLICATION**

**One-Liner**: The central Control Plane for managing all users, resources, and billing.

**‚úÖ In-Scope Features:**

- User sign-up, sign-in, and profile management
- Organization, Project, and Resource CRUD operations
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) at organization and project level
- Billing account management, subscription logic, and invoicing integration
- Central user dashboard for viewing and navigating to all resources
- Konnektr Platform API for all management tasks
- Resource lifecycle management across all products

**‚ùå Out-of-Scope:**

- Internal business logic of any products (graph queries, flow execution, etc.)
- Direct deployment of infrastructure (handled by DB Query Operator)
- Product-specific UI functionality

**üîå Interactions:**

- **All Applications**: Provides central authentication service
- **DB Query Operator**: Writes desired state to database for reconciliation
- **Product Applications**: Consume KtrlPlane API for resource management

---

### DB Query Operator (Infrastructure)

**One-Liner**: Kubernetes operator that reconciles desired state from database with cluster state.

**‚úÖ In-Scope:**

- Watch database tables for state changes
- Create/update/delete Kubernetes resources based on database records
- Update resource status in database upon reconciliation

**‚ùå Out-of-Scope:**

- Business logic, user interaction, or API exposure

---

### Konnektr Home Page (Marketing)

**One-Liner**: Public-facing marketing and information website.

**‚úÖ In-Scope:**

- Product information, pricing, blog, documentation links
- Interactive demos and marketing content

**‚ùå Out-of-Scope:**

- User authentication or user-specific data
- Resource management functionality

---

### Konnektr Assembler (AI Builder)

**One-Liner**: AI-powered builder for creating digital twin models.

**‚úÖ In-Scope:**

- Data source connection UI
- AI-powered DTDL model generation
- Visual graph editor for model refinement
- Model validation and deployment workflow

**‚ùå Out-of-Scope:**

- Direct infrastructure deployment
- Long-term data storage
- Running the final digital twin

**üîå Key Interaction:**

- Calls KtrlPlane API to request creation of Graph and Flow resources

---

### Konnektr Graph (formerly AgeDigitalTwins)

**One-Liner**: High-performance, ADT-compatible digital twin runtime and graph database.

**‚úÖ In-Scope:**

- ADT-compatible REST API for twin operations
- Real-time eventing system for state changes
- Query execution engine (Cypher over Apache AGE)

**‚ùå Out-of-Scope:**

- User authentication (validates KtrlPlane tokens)
- Billing or self-management
- UI components

**üîå Key Interactions:**

- Validates JWTs from KtrlPlane
- Consumed by Flow and Compass applications

---

### Konnektr Flow (Data Processing)

**One-Liner**: Real-time data ingestion and event orchestration engine.

**‚úÖ In-Scope:**

- Visual workflow editor
- Data source connectors library
- Serverless runtime for flow execution
- Flow monitoring and logging

**‚ùå Out-of-Scope:**

- Primary twin graph storage
- Direct resource provisioning

**üîå Key Interactions:**

- Authenticates via KtrlPlane
- Primary client of Konnektr Graph API

---

### Konnektr Compass (Analytics)

**One-Liner**: Analytics, visualization, and simulation layer.

**‚úÖ In-Scope:**

- Dashboarding and visualization tools
- "What-if" simulation engine
- Cross-twin analytical queries

**‚ùå Out-of-Scope:**

- Twin lifecycle management
- Data ingestion

**üîå Key Interactions:**

- Uses KtrlPlane for permissions
- Queries Konnektr Graph for analytics

## üö® Scope Enforcement Rules

### For KtrlPlane Development:

**‚úÖ Always Do:**

- Implement user, organization, and project management
- Handle billing and subscription management
- Provide RBAC and access control
- Expose APIs for other applications to consume
- Manage resource lifecycle through database records

**‚ùå Never Do:**

- Implement graph query logic (that's Graph's job)
- Build flow execution engines (that's Flow's job)
- Create separate authentication systems for products
- Directly deploy Kubernetes resources (that's the operator's job)
- Store product-specific business data

### Cross-Application Communication:

**‚úÖ Allowed:**

- REST/gRPC API calls between applications
- Event-based communication via message bus
- Reading from shared configuration systems

**‚ùå Forbidden:**

- Direct database connections between applications
- Shared in-memory state
- Direct file system sharing
- Bypassing API boundaries

## üîÑ Boundary Evolution

When requirements blur these boundaries:

1. **First**: Try to solve within existing scope
2. **Second**: Extend APIs to support the use case
3. **Last Resort**: Discuss boundary changes with architecture team

## üìù Compliance Checklist

Before implementing any feature, verify:

- [ ] Does this belong in KtrlPlane's scope?
- [ ] Am I maintaining separation from Data Plane logic?
- [ ] Are all external interactions through defined APIs?
- [ ] Does this maintain centralized auth/billing principles?
- [ ] Will this work with the db-query-operator model?

## üìã Change Log

- **2025-01-27**: Initial platform scope document created
- **2025-09-25**: Updated product names (AgeDigitalTwins ‚Üí Konnektr Graph, clarified product descriptions)

---

**Remember**: These boundaries exist to prevent chaos and technical debt. When in doubt, choose the more restrictive interpretation and discuss with the team.
