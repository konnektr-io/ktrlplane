# Access Control

KtrlPlane uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions at three hierarchical scopes: organization, project, and resource.

## Core Principles
- **Scoped Roles**: Roles are always assigned within a scope (org, project, resource)
- **Least Privilege**: Users should receive only the permissions necessary
- **Composability**: Access can layerâ€”organization visibility and project edit rights, for example
- **Auditability**: Role assignments form the backbone of audit trails

## Scopes
| Scope | Example | Role Examples | Description |
|-------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Organization | `org-abc123` | org_owner, org_admin, org_viewer | Top-level grouping boundary |
| Project | `proj-xyz123` | project_owner, project_editor, project_viewer | Application/workspace boundary |
| Resource | `res-graph-01` | resource_editor, resource_viewer | Individual deployable unit |

## Roles (Conceptual)
| Role | Typical Permissions |
|------|---------------------|
| org_owner | Manage organization + billing + projects |
| org_admin | Manage organization configuration |
| org_viewer | Read-only organization visibility |
| project_owner | Full project control including billing override |
| project_editor | Create/update resources |
| project_viewer | Read-only project and resources |
| resource_editor | Change resource configuration |
| resource_viewer | View resource status, metrics, logs |

## Permission Evaluation
1. Authenticate user (JWT token)
2. Identify scope from request path
3. Load role assignments for user + scope
4. Resolve permissions and compare against required action

## Best Practices
- Periodically audit high-privilege roles
- Use resource-level roles only when finer granularity is required
- Prefer project-level roles for most collaboration scenarios

## Common Scenarios
- A user needs to view logs: must have resource_viewer or project_viewer (with access) + logs feature enabled
- A user needs to change resource settings: resource_editor or project_editor
- A user needs to delete a project: project_owner
