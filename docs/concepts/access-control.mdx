# Access Control

KtrlPlane uses a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system to ensure that users have exactly the permissions they need—no more, no less. Permissions are managed hierarchically across three scopes: **Organization**, **Project**, and **Resource**.

## Permission Scopes

Access can be granted at three different levels. Permissions granted at a higher level automatically inherit down to lower levels.

| Scope | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Organization** | The top-level boundary. Roles assigned here apply to the entire organization and all projects within it. | granting `Owner` on the Organization gives full control over all projects. |
| **Project** | A workspace for related resources. Roles assigned here apply to all resources within the project. | Granting `Viewer` on a Project allows a user to see all resources in that project. |
| **Resource** | The individual deployable unit (e.g., a specific Graph or Secret). Roles assigned here apply ONLY to that specific resource. | Granting `Editor` on a specific Secret allows modifying that secret but nothing else. |

## System Roles

KtrlPlane provides a set of pre-defined roles designed to cover common access patterns. These roles are categorized into **Platform Access**, **Data Access**, and **Resource-Specific Access**.

### Platform Access Roles
These roles control access to the KtrlPlane control plane (configuration, deployment, settings).

| Role | Permissions | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Owner** | Full administrative access. Can manage billing, users, roles, and delete the scope (Project/Org). | Organization Admins, Project Leads |
| **Editor** | Can create, update, and delete resources. Cannot manage user access or billing. | Developers, DevOps Engineers |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to configuration and status. Cannot make any changes. | Auditors, Support Staff, Stakeholders |

### Data Access Roles
These roles control access to the *data plane*—the actual data stored within your resources.

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Konnektr.Data.Owner** | Grants full access to the data within resources. For example, allows querying all nodes in a Graph or reading values in a Secret. |

<Callout type="info">
  **Control Plane vs. Data Plane**: An `Editor` can change the configuration of a database (Control Plane) but might not have permission to read the customer data inside it (Data Plane). Assign `Konnektr.Data.Owner` to grant data access.
</Callout>

### Resource-Specific Roles
These roles are tailored for specific resource types and offer more granular control.

*   **Konnektr.Graph.Owner**, **Konnektr.Graph.Editor**, **Konnektr.Graph.Viewer**
*   **Konnektr.Flow.Owner**, **Konnektr.Flow.Editor**, **Konnektr.Flow.Viewer**
*   **Konnektr.Secret.Owner**, **Konnektr.Secret.Editor**, **Konnektr.Secret.Viewer**

Use these when you need to grant access to a specific *type* of resource without granting blanket access to the entire project.

## Inheritance Model

Permissions are additive and hierarchical.
*   **Organization Owner** implies **Project Owner** for all projects.
*   **Project Viewer** implies **Resource Viewer** for all resources in that project.

Best Practice: Assign roles at the **Project** level for teams to reduce management overhead. Use **Resource** level assignments only for exceptions (e.g., a specific secret that only one person should see).

## Managing Access

To manage access:
1.  Navigate to the scope you want to manage (Organization Settings, Project Settings, or Resource Details).
2.  Click on the **"Access"** or **"Permissions"** tab.
3.  Click **"Add Assignment"**.
4.  Select the **User** (by email) and the **Role**.
5.  Save the assignment.

Effective permissions are calculated instantly, allowing users immediate access.
