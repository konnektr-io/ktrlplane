# Organizations

Organizations are the highest-level grouping construct in KtrlPlane. They represent a company, business unit, or major team boundary.

## Purpose
- Group related projects
- Provide a shared billing context
- Define a top-level RBAC boundary (org_owner, org_admin, org_viewer)
- Serve as a logical tenant anchor for multi-tenancy

## Key Characteristics
| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Multi-tenancy | Each organization establishes isolation across data and access |
| Billing | Can own billing settings or allow project-specific overrides |
| Membership | Users may belong to multiple organizations |
| Governance | Central place to enforce policies and audit access |

## Lifecycle
1. Creation: An initial owner establishes the organization
2. Project Provisioning: Projects are added under the organization
3. Growth: Roles and billing are refined as usage scales
4. Decommissioning: Resources and projects archived prior to deletion

## RBAC Overview
Organization-level roles often influence which projects are visible and manageable.

## Best Practices
- Use descriptive names (e.g., "Acme Data Platform")
- Centralize billing at the organization unless specific chargeback is required
- Periodically audit role assignments
