# Projects

Projects are operational workspaces that group resources and define an RBAC boundary for day-to-day execution.

## Purpose
- Provide a focused context for an application or workload
- Group related resources (Graph, Flow, Assembler, Compass)
- Act as a billing scope (inherit or override organization billing)
- Enable scoped role assignments (project_owner, project_editor, project_viewer)

## When to Create a New Project
Create a new project when:
- You have a logical application boundary
- Different teams manage separate workloads
- You require isolated access control for a feature set
- You want to segment billing or usage reporting

## Project Lifecycle
1. Initialization: Project defined with name and organization association
2. Resource Provisioning: Platform resources created inside the project
3. Expansion: Additional roles and monitoring added
4. Evolution: Configuration updated based on scaling needs
5. Archival: Project retired and resources terminated

## RBAC Scope
Project-level roles govern access to all resources within the project unless overridden by resource-specific roles.

## Billing Inheritance
Projects can inherit billing from the parent organization or specify their own subscription context.

## Best Practices
- Use consistent naming patterns (e.g., `data-analytics-prod`)
- Keep resource count manageable for clarity
- Regularly review resource health and RBAC assignments
