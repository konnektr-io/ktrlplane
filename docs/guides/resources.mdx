</Callout>

### Step 4: Configuration

Configure your resource settings based on your requirements:

#### Graph Configuration Example
```json
{
  "database_name": "production-twins",
  "enable_analytics": true,
  "backup_retention_days": 30,
  "query_timeout_seconds": 60,
  "max_concurrent_connections": 200,
  "enable_audit_logging": true,
  "performance_tier": "standard",
  "auto_scaling": {
    "enabled": true,
    "min_capacity": 2,
    "max_capacity": 10
  }
}
```

#### Flow Configuration Example
```json
{
  "max_concurrent_flows": 25,
  "retention_days": 90,
  "enable_dead_letter_queue": true,
  "processing_mode": "streaming",
  "error_handling": "retry_with_backoff",
  "auto_scaling": {
    "enabled": true,
    "min_instances": 2,
    "max_instances": 20,
    "target_cpu_utilization": 70
  }
}
```

#### Assembler Configuration Example
```json
{
  "model_complexity": "standard",
  "output_format": "dtdl_v2",
  "confidence_threshold": 0.8
}
```

### Step 5: Deployment

1. Review your configuration
2. Click **"Create Resource"**
3. Monitor the deployment progress
4. Wait for the resource to become available (typically 2-5 minutes)

## Managing Existing Resources

### Resource Dashboard

Your resource dashboard provides:

**Status Overview**
- Current operational status
- Health and performance metrics
- Recent activity and events
- Resource utilization

**Quick Actions**
- Access resource endpoints
- View configuration
- Update settings
- Scale resource
- Access logs

### Updating Resource Configuration

Most settings can be updated without recreating the resource:

1. Navigate to your resource
2. Click **"Settings"**
3. Modify the configuration
4. Click **"Save Changes"**
5. Monitor the update process

<Callout type="warning">
Some configuration changes may cause brief service interruptions. Plan updates during maintenance windows when possible.
</Callout>

### Scaling Resources

#### Manual Scaling
Adjust resource capacity based on current needs:

1. Go to resource settings
2. Find the scaling section
3. Adjust capacity limits or performance tiers
4. Apply changes

#### Auto-Scaling (Future Feature)
Automatic scaling based on resource metrics is planned for future releases. Currently, you can manually adjust resource configuration through the dashboard or API.

## Resource Integration

### Inter-Resource Communication

Resources within the same project can communicate using internal service discovery:

```javascript
// Graph to Flow integration
const flowClient = new FlowClient({
  endpoint: process.env.FLOW_INTERNAL_ENDPOINT,
  authentication: 'service_account'
});

// Assembler to Graph integration  
const graphClient = new GraphClient({
  endpoint: process.env.GRAPH_INTERNAL_ENDPOINT,
  authentication: 'service_account'
});
```

### External Integrations

Connect your resources to external services:

#### API Integration
```javascript
// Configure external API endpoint in resource settings
{
  "external_apis": {
    "weather_service": {
      "endpoint": "https://api.weather.com/v1",
      "authentication": "api_key",
      "rate_limit": 1000
    }
  }
}
```

#### Webhook Configuration
```json
{
  "webhooks": {
    "incoming": {
      "endpoint": "/webhooks/data-ingestion",
      "authentication": "hmac_sha256",
      "payload_validation": true
    },
    "outgoing": {
      "alerts": "https://your-system.com/alerts",
      "events": "https://your-system.com/events"
    }
  }
}
```

## Security and Access Control

### API Key Management

Each resource provides API keys for programmatic access:

1. Navigate to resource settings
2. Go to **"API Keys"** section
3. Click **"Generate New Key"**
4. Configure key permissions and expiration
5. Copy the key (it won't be shown again)

### Resource-Level Permissions

Control who can access and modify resources:

- **Viewer**: Read-only access to resource data and configuration
- **Editor**: Can modify configuration and manage the resource
- **Admin**: Full access including security settings and key management

### Network Security

Configure network access controls:

```json
{
  "network_security": {
    "ip_whitelist": [
      "192.168.1.0/24",
      "10.0.0.0/8"
    ],
    "enable_private_endpoints": true,
    "require_tls": true,
    "min_tls_version": "1.2"
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Built-in Monitoring

KtrlPlane provides comprehensive monitoring for all resources:

**Performance Metrics**
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Request throughput and error rates
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, storage)
- Custom business metrics

**Operational Metrics**
- Service availability and uptime
- Deployment and configuration changes
- Error patterns and trends
- Cost and billing information

### Custom Monitoring

Add custom metrics to your resources:

```javascript
// Graph resource custom metrics
const metrics = {
  nodes_created_per_minute: nodeCreationRate,
  query_complexity_average: averageQueryComplexity,
  relationship_depth_max: maxRelationshipDepth
};

await graphResource.recordMetrics(metrics);
```

### Alerting

Set up alerts for important events:

1. Go to resource monitoring
2. Click **"Create Alert"**
3. Choose alert conditions:
   - Performance thresholds
   - Error rate limits
   - Resource utilization
   - Cost thresholds
4. Configure notification channels (email, Slack, webhooks)
5. Save alert configuration
