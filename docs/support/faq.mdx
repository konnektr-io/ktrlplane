## General Questions

### What is KtrlPlane?

KtrlPlane is the centralized Control Plane for the Konnektr Platform. It manages organizations, projects, resources, billing, and access control for all Konnektr products (Graph, Flow, Assembler, and Compass).

### How does KtrlPlane relate to other Konnektr products?

KtrlPlane serves as the management layer for the entire Konnektr ecosystem:

- **KtrlPlane**: Control Plane - manages users, projects, billing, and deployments
- **Konnektr.Graph**: Graph database and API layer for digital twin data
- **Konnektr.Flow**: Real-time data and event processing
- **Konnektr.Assembler**: AI-powered digital twin builder
- **Konnektr.Compass**: Navigation and discovery tools (coming soon)

### Is KtrlPlane free to use?

KtrlPlane itself is free - you only pay for the resources you deploy. Each resource type (Graph, Flow, Assembler) offers free tiers perfect for development and small projects.

## Account and Authentication

### How do I create an account?

Simply visit the KtrlPlane web interface and click "Sign Up". You'll need to provide an email address and create a password. Email verification is required before you can start using the platform.

### Can I use single sign-on (SSO)?

Yes, KtrlPlane supports Auth0-based authentication, which can be configured for various SSO providers including Google, Microsoft, SAML, and more.

### How do I reset my password?

Click "Forgot Password" on the login page and enter your email address. You'll receive a password reset link via email.

### Can I change my email address?

Currently, email address changes must be done through your Auth0 profile. Contact support if you need assistance with this.

## Organizations and Projects

### What's the difference between organizations and projects?

- **Organizations**: Top-level containers representing your company or team. Handle billing, team management, and company-wide policies.
- **Projects**: Workspaces within organizations where you deploy and manage resources. Each project can have its own team members and access controls.

### How many organizations can I create?

There's no limit on the number of organizations you can create. Most users start with one organization and create additional ones only when needed for business separation.

### Can I transfer projects between organizations?

Currently, projects cannot be transferred between organizations. However, you can create a new project in the target organization and migrate your resources individually.

### How do I invite team members?

Go to your organization or project settings, click "Access Control", then "Invite User". Enter their email address and select the appropriate role. They'll receive an invitation email with instructions to join.

## Resources and Billing

### What resource types are available?

KtrlPlane supports four main resource types:

1. **Konnektr.Graph**: Graph database for connected data and digital twins
2. **Konnektr.Flow**: Real-time event and data processing
3. **Konnektr.Assembler**: AI-powered digital twin model builder
4. **Konnektr.Compass**: Navigation and discovery (coming soon)

### How is billing calculated?

Billing is resource-based with three components:
- **Base tier cost**: Monthly fee for your selected tier (Free, Pro, Enterprise)
- **Usage charges**: Additional costs for usage beyond tier limits
- **Storage costs**: Data storage charges for persistent data

### Can I change resource tiers after creation?

Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade resource tiers at any time. Changes take effect immediately, and billing is prorated to reflect the change.

### What happens if I exceed my tier limits?

- **Free tier**: Your resource may be temporarily throttled or paused
- **Paid tiers**: You'll be charged for additional usage beyond your tier limits
- **All tiers**: You'll receive email notifications when approaching limits

### How do I set up billing alerts?

Go to your organization or project billing settings and configure alert thresholds. You can set alerts for:
- Monthly spending limits
- Usage approaching tier limits
- Unexpected billing increases
